About this library
------------------
ISO_Fortran_binding supports C/Fortran interoperability by providing the [Fortran 2018 Draft International Standard]'s `ISO_Fortran_binding.h` C header file, corresponding function definitions, and CMake scripts for building, testing, and installing static and dynamic libraries. C programs may use the provided function to manipulate interoperable Fortran data objects by exploiting metadata describing the type, rank, extents, contiguity, and other information about the object.  

* `CFI_allocate`, `CFI_deallocate`. Allocate or deallocate Fortran allocatable variables. üêè 
* `CFI_establish`. Establish the metadata necessary to access Fortran variables inside a C descriptor `struct`.
* `CFI_address`. If a C descriptor describes a scalar variable, find its address. If it describes an array, find the address of the element with column-major (Fortran ordering) indexing. :house:
* `CFI_is_contiguous`. Determine whether a Fortran array is contiguous.
* `CFI_select_part`. Update a C descriptor to select an element or contiguous elements of a Fortran derived type. The variable whose part is selected could be an array section of derived type. üö£‚Äç 
* `CFI_section`. Update a C descriptor to select a section of an array. The array can be of interoperable derived types. The array can also be composed of elements of a derived type, i.e., a C descriptor updated by `CFI_select_part`. The array can also be a section.
* `CFI_setpointer`: Update a C descriptor to point at a Fortran variable. üèπ
